Getting and Cleaning Data Project
=================================

This project contains all scripts and tidy data set outcome from the analisys done cleaning a wearable computing dataset located at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

Includes three (3) files:

1) Codebook.txt, contains information about the tidy data set created (tidy_data_avg_activity_user) describing each variable and each values in the dataset.

2) tidydata.R, an end to end script that: 

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set that are provided at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  

*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

3) tidy_data_avg_activity_user.txt, the tidy data set output by the script.
